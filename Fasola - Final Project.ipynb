    "For my final project, I decided to analyze relationships between countries regarding the trends of the novel coronavirus.  I was hesitant to choose this topic due to its 'popularity'; however, I am curious in the subject as it is constantly evolving.  I last pulled the data on April 7, 2020.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My goal for this project is to analyze trends of the coronavirus.  More specifically, I want to see if there was a correlation between economic statistics for certain countries and the toll the virus has taken there.  For example, have countries which spend a higher percentage of their GDP on health expenditures been less affected by the disease?  Or, are those countries with a larger population of elderly (aged 65+) more susceptible to higher death rates due to the virus?  \n",
    "\n",
    "I downloaded all of my data from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho) or the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases).  The data from the Humanitarian Data Exchange is where I obtained the data about the coronavirus.  To quote their website, \"The data is compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) from various sources including the World Health Organization (WHO), DXY.cn. Pneumonia. 2020, BNO News, National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (NHC), China CDC (CCDC), Hong Kong Department of Health, Macau Government, Taiwan CDC, US CDC, Government of Canada, Australia Government Department of Health, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Ministry of Health Singapore (MOH).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing a reputable name like John Hopkins, I know this is trusted and accurate data.  Also, considering one of their sources is the World Health Organization (WHO), I believe my datasets will be compatible."

However, upon further analysis of the data, each date column is the cumulative count of total cases already.\n",

    "With that said, I dropped each column except for 'Province/State', 'Country/Region' and '4/7/2020' (showing the most up-to-date data).  Based on that data, I did a `.sum()` to obtain that same value.  Then, I used `.sort_values()` and `.head(10)` to show the top ten countries by province/state with the most COVID-19 cases.\n",
